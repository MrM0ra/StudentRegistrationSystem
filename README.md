# StudentSystem
Fullstack app developed with Spring, React and MySQL


Steps to run it on your local machine

* Clone the repository as you will clone any other repo
* Import the spring boot project into your IDE 
* You might as well wanna download MySQL and create a new database
*   You can call it whatever you wanna call it but i sugest you to name it and run it studentsystem as it is configured that way on the pproject
*   In case you name it differently go to spring boot project's application properties file and change the value for the field spring.datasource.url to whatever you named your db
*   Also the fields spring.datasource.username=root and spring.datasource.username=root for whatever your username and password are
* Open the React project and run it (Default address is localhost:3000)
